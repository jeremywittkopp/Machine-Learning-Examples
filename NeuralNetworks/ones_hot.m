function yp = ones_hot(flag, y)
    % This function will be used to convert between integer labels and
    % ones-hot labels. If the labels are integers and there are C classes,
    % then the labels will be one of {1, 2, ..., C}. If the labels are in
    % ones-hot form, then each label will be a Cx1 vector containing all
    % zeros except one element whose index corresponds to the class. Note
    % that in the case of binary classification (i.e., either zero or one),
    % then this won't touch the output labels.
    %
    % INPUTS:
    %       flag (str)              Flag toggling between integer labels or
    %                               ones-hot labels
    %       y (Mx1 array)           Original output of integer labels
    %         (CxM array)           Original output of ones-hot labels
    % 
    % OUTPUT:
    %       yp (Mx1 array)          New output of integer labels
    %          (CxM array)          New output of ones-hot labels
    
    % Handle the case of conversion from integer to ones-hot labels. This 
    % will be used primarily when training the neural network since the 
    % output layer activations will be a CxM matrix.
    if (strcmp(flag, 'ones-hot'))
        
        % Get the number of training examples and initialize the new output
        % matrix. Note that since the mathematics are annoying, I am 
        % flipping the output matrix so that it is a CxM matrix instead of 
        % an MxC matrix.
        M = size(y, 1);
        yp = zeros(max(y), M);

        % Iterate over each training example and get its corresponding 
        % integer label. Use this to find the corresponding element in its 
        % ones-hot vector representation to set equal to one.
        for i = 1: M
            yp(y(i), i) = 1;
        end

    % Handle the case of conversion from ones-hot to integer labels. This 
    % will be used primarily when making predictions with the neural 
    % network.
    elseif (strcmp(flag, 'integer'))

        % Get the number of training examples and initialize the new
        % output matrix. Note that in order to jibe with the original
        % output matrix, I am once again taking the transpose of the
        % results (similar to binary classification).
        M = size(y, 2);
        yp = zeros(M, 1);

        % Iterate over each training example and find where the ones-hot 
        % label is equal to one. The index corresponding to this point will
        % be the integer label.
        for i = 1: M
            yp(i) = find(y(:, i) == 1);
